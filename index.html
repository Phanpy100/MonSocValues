<h2>What is MonSocValues?</h2>
    <p>MonSocValues is a political quiz which tries to categorize the strains of Monarcho-Socialism in several boxes in <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions, it's build on the 8values code.</p>

<h2>What are the values?</h2>
    <p>There are six independent axes - Economic, Diplomatic, Constitutional, Cultural, Empowerment and Unity - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#A52639;">Scientific</b> (Economic)<br/>
        Those with higher Scientific scores believe the economy should be distributed in a way similar to traditional leftist values, and at higher scores, Marxism</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#B22E69;">Co-operative</b> (Economic)<br/>
        Those with higher Market scores believe the economy should be regulated, but not fully embracing traditional leftist values, often third positionist, and at higher scores, Distributism.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#f57c00;">Nation</b> (Diplomatic)<br/>
        Those with higher Nation scores are patriotic and nationalist. They often believe in an aggressive foreign policy, valuing the military, strength, sovereignty, and at high values, territorial expansion.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0288d1;">Internationalist</b> (Diplomatic)<br/>
        Those with higher Internationalist scores are cosmopolitan and globalist. They often believe in a peaceful foreign policy, emphasizing diplomacy, cooperation, integration, and at high values, a world government.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#FFE091;">Constitution</b> (Constitutional)<br/>
        Those with higher Constitution scores believe in strong civil liberties. They tend to support parlimentary democracy and oppose absolutism, and at higher values anarcho-monarchism.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#5D2F8C;">Absolutism</b> (Constitutional)<br/>
        Those with higher Authority scores believe in strong state power. Being directly by the king or a defacto dictator, and at high values even believing in divine right.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#689f38;">Reaction</b> (Cultural)<br/>
        Those with higher Reaction scores believe in traditional values and strict adherence to a moral code. Though not always, they are usually religious, and support the status quo or the status quo ante.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7b1fa2;">Progress</b> (Cultural)<br/>
        Those with higher Progress scores believe in social change and rationality. Though not always, they are usually secular or atheist, and support environmental action and scientific or technological research.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#721C2F;">Revolt</b> (Empowerment)<br/>
        Those with higher Revolt scores believe that a democratic transition to Monarcho-Socialism is either impossible or unpreferable, and at higher scores even embracing values like permanent revolution.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#FF6675;">Reform</b> (Empowerment)<br/>
        Those with higher Reform scores believe that a democratic transition to Monarcho-Socialism is preferable and possible, at higher scores embracing values similar to utopian socialism where we can simply convince the rich to join their cause instead.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#DD3745;">Left Unity</b> (Unity)<br/>
        Those with higher Left Unity scores believe that you can better ally with socialists and other leftists rather then the monarchists.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#854CBF;">Royal Unity</b> (Unity)<br/>
        Those with higher Royal Unity scores believe that the left only hold Monarcho-Socialism down as a joke and that Monarcho-Socialists should rather align themselves with existing monarchist movements.</p>
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the twelve values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political ideology. This is a work in progress and is much less accurate than the values and axes, so don't take it too seriously. If you disagree with your assigned ideology, Please see below. Thanks!</p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
